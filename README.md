# CodeDemo

I interned at a company named Timmmons Group for 4 months last spring. I worked extensively on their website @

https://fireconnect.tfs.tamu.edu/

When I learned that Code Fellows wanted to see a website I've worked on, I attempted to regain access to some of the pages that I worked on so that I could show them to you as I talked about them. 

The problem is that the public facing side was already built when I joined the team. And instead I worked on content reserved for those within the fire department. 

I will still use Canvas to explain what it is I worked on with this website. 
But I assume you also want to see something real. 


so as a quick substitue, I went ahead and built a simple cat adoption site using VUE. 
I do not have a domain of my own to offer you a link to. 
Instead, I'm offereing the .html .css and .js files and a link to the codepen sandbox.

https://codepen.io/pen/

I pieced together some of the code from various Vue Mastery projects, including the script src on line 9 of the html file. 
I had 6 hours left to complete this test question. I figured the best use of my time was to show you how I'm able to recongize and manipulate the information towards my own objective (adopting cats).

Let me know if I left anything out,
Joelle
